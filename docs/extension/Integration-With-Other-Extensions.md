# Integration with other extensions
These are the extensions that StructuredNavigation currently integrates with.
 - **CodeEditor**: When editing navigations in the Navigation namespace, CodeEditor will provide syntax highlighting for the content as JSON.
 - **TemplateStyles**: No technical integrations, but this extensions works quite smoothly with TemplateStyles for adding custom styles to navigations. A [guide is available](./Styling-with-TemplateStyles.md) for learning how to do this.

## Planned, upcoming integrations
The list below are extensions that StructuredNavigation will integrate with in the upcoming future.

 - **SyntaxHighlight GeSHi**: You will be able to view Special:NavigationSchema with a syntax-highlighted JSON schema. (originally tracked in [#41](https://github.com/neoncitylights/StructuredNavigation/issues/41))
 - **VisualEditor**: You will be able to insert a structured navigation through the VisualEditor interface. (originally tracked in [#42](https://github.com/neoncitylights/StructuredNavigation/issues/42))
