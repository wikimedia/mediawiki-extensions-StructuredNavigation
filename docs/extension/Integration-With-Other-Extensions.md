# Integration with other extensions
These are the extensions that StructuredNavigation currently integrates with.

 - **CodeMirror**: When you're using CodeMirror, the `mw-navigation` parser tag will have syntax highlighting.
 - **TemplateStyles**: No technical integrations, but this extensions works quite smoothly with TemplateStyles for adding custom styles to navigations. A [guide is available](./Styling-with-TemplateStyles.md) for learning how to do this.

## Planned, upcoming integrations
The list below are extensions that StructuredNavigation will integrate with in the upcoming future.

 - **SyntaxHighlight GeSHi**: You will be able to view Special:NavigationSchema with a syntax-highlighted JSON schema. (tracked in [#41](https://github.com/SamanthaNguyen/mediawiki-extensions-StructuredNavigation/issues/41))
 - **VisualEditor**: You will be able to insert a structured navigation through the VisualEditor interface. (tracked in [#42](https://github.com/SamanthaNguyen/mediawiki-extensions-StructuredNavigation/issues/42))
